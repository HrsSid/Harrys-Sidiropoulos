# My Skills

I have skills in front-end development, back-end development, and software development. While I have experience in these areas, I acknowledge that my skills are not perfect and there is always room for improvement.

As a front-end developer, I can create visually satisfying user interfaces that are both intuitive and engaging. I am decent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since I am not perfect I am committed to enhancing my skills in these areas

As a software developer, I possess a broad range of skills and experience, enabling me to work on a variety of projects. I have a deep understanding of software development principles and methodologies, and I am skilled in designing, building, testing, and deploying software applications. While I have a solid foundation in these areas, I know that the field of software development is constantly evolving, and I am committed to continuously learning and improving my skills to deliver the best possible results for my clients. My only limitation is that I only work with python in software development.
