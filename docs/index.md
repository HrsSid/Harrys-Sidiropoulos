## About Me

Hello, my name is <span class="special">Harrys Sidiropoulos</span>, i was born in 2008 and I am from greece. In my free time I love to practice my skills in programming. I practice <span class="special">web development</span> or <span class="special">software development</span>.

In 2017 I started learning <span class="special">Python</span> and it was my first interaction with a computer language. In 2020 I was first introduced to <span class="special">HTML</span> in my school. Some months later I decided to build a simple portfolio for myself, so I learnt <span class="special">HTML</span> and some basic <span class="special">CSS</span>. For my first website ever i was <span class="special">very happy</span>. Two months later I decided to improve the website and make it more advanced. So that I did. I learnt <span class="special">CSS</span> and I wrote my first lines of JavaScript. The website was updated overtime and now it is my best pure <span class="special">HTML</span>, <span class="special">CSS</span> and <span class="special">JavaScript</span> website, without any frameworks or tools.
